# This Website is to display My portfolio of work. 

What is displayed is header information with my name and the ability to click on a navigation bar to take you to various parts of the website; a small part about who I am and working experience, including a change into Softare Developement; My work which shows the projects I've worked on while a Software Developer; and finally a way to contact me via email or social media.
